# Module 4 -  Final Project Specifications

## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll review all the guidelines and specifications for the final project for Module 4.

## Objectives

* Identify all required aspects of the Final Project for Module 4
* Describe all required deliverables
* Summarize what constitutes a successful project

### Final Project Summary

Another module down--you're absolutely crushing it! For this project, you'll get to flex your **_Regression & Time-Series_** muscles!

For this module's final project, we're going to put your new found **Regression & Time Series Analysis** skills to the test.

### The Project

For this project, you will be acting as a consultant for a fictional firm. As a part of your data exploration, come up with a _driving question_ based on this data. <br>

For example, if you were given a data set of housing price data for a given city, a driving question might be:

> Based on forecasts, what are the top 5 best zipcodes for us to invest in?


## The Deliverables

The goal of this project is to have you complete a very common real-world task in regard to Regression and Time-Series Modeling. However, real world problems often come with a significant degree of ambiguity, which requires you to use your knowledge of statistics and data science to think critically about and answer.

In short, to pass this project, demonstrating the quality and thoughtfulness of your **overall recommendation** is at least as important as successfully building your models!

In order to successfully complete this project, you must have:

* A well-documented technical **_Jupyter Notebook_** containing the rational and decisions of your project.
* A dataset that is not overly used online in data science examples. 
 * Contain a link to both your dirty and cleaned dataset in your code. Consider using a site such as [DataHub](https://datahub.io/) to host and import your data files. 
* Well organized code in modularized .py files.
* **Concrete recommendations** that connect back to the business questions. Focusing the presentation on the results of t-tests, assumption tests, and R squared will not consitute a sucessful project. 
* An **_'Executive Summary' Presentation_** that explains your rationale and methodology for determining the best zipcodes for investment(for example).


### Jupyter Notebook Must-Haves

1. You must source & clean your data.  All boring stuff should be pushed to a .py file that is imported.  A single data set (albeit possibly from multiple sources) should be able to support all of the following requirements.
2. You can do a regression or a time series analysis, using $R^2$ and AIC/BIC or MSE to determine the best of model
3. Visualizations to support each of your models built

#### Organization/Code Cleanliness

The notebook should be well organized, easy to follow, and code is modularized and commented where appropriate.

* High level: 
 - The notebook contains well-formatted, professional looking markdown cells.
 - Only functions from imported modules are used in the notebook itself
 - Functions are organized well in different name-space related `.py` files (data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, assumption checking, etc) 
 - All functions have docstrings that act as professional-quality documentation
 - All `.py` files are pass linter tests and use PEP8 style guide
* The notebook is written to _technical audiences_ with a way to both understand your approach and reproduce your results. The target audience for this deliverable is other data scientists looking to validate your findings.
* Data visualizations you create should be clearly labeled and contextualized--that is, they fit with the surrounding code or problems you're trying to solve. No dropping data visualizations randomly around your notebook without any context!

### Version Control
- Project deliverables should be stored in a github repo with a descriptive name (`Predicting Impact of USAID grants on Women's Safety in Congo` vs `Mod 4 project`)
- Final project material should live on the *master* branch
- At least 8 commits over the course of the project, with at least two from each team member. 

#### Findings

Your notebook should briefly mention the metrics you have defined as "best", so that any readers understand what technical metrics you are trying to optimize. You do **not** need to explain or defend your your choices in the notebook--the blog post and executive summary presentation are both better suited to that sort of content. However, the notebook should provide enough context about your definition for "best investment" so that they understand what the code you are writing is trying to solve.

#### Visualizations

Regression & Time-Series Analysis are areas of data science that lend themselves well to intuitive data visualizations. **_Any findings worth mentioning in this problem are probably also worth visualizing_**. Your notebook should make use of data visualizations as appropriate to make your findings obvious to any readers.

Also, remember that if a visualization is worth creating, then it's also worth taking the extra few minutes to make sure that it is easily understandable and well-formatted. When creating visualizations, make sure that they have:

* A title
* Clearly labeled X and Y axes, with appropriate scale for each
* A legend, when necessary
* No overlapping text that makes it hard to read
* An intelligent use of color--multiple lines should have different colors and/or symbols to make them easily differentiable to the eye (please, no rainbow color scheme)
* An appropriate amount of information--avoid creating graphs that are "too busy"--for instance, don't create a line graph with 25 different lines on it

### Executive Summary Must-Haves

Your presentation should:

- Be aimed at a non-technical audience
 - Avoid technical jargon and explain results in a clear, actionable way for non-technical audiences.
- Contain between 5-10 professional quality slides detailing:
 - A high-level overview of your methodology and findings including the 5 zipcodes you recommend investing in (for example)
 - A brief explanation of what metrics you defined as "best" in order complete this project
- Take no more than 5 minutes to present
