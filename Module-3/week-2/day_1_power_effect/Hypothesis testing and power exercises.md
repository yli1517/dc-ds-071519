## Hypothesis testing and power exercises


### Cleaning Steps
1. Create a new Jupyter notebook in a new folder
2. Create a `data` folder within this folder
3. Downlooad the data from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eGHQMsnJrfnA7djKU6k39k475l-KI1mN/view?usp=sharing) or [here](https://www.kaggle.com/cityofLA/city-payroll-data) and unzip it and save the csv in the data folder.
4. Load the csv into the jupyter notebook.
5. Import the module and run the function `clean_payroll_data` on your dataset.

### Hypothesis Testing Questions
#### Split into three groups
Using sample sizes of 30 from each population, test the folling questions about the variable `annual_sal`:

1. Is the average salary of people working in the Mayor's office different from someone working in the Zoo Department?
2. Did the average salary accross all departments increase or stay the same from 2014 to 2015?
3. Do people in Public Works - Contract Administration make the same as Public Works - Engineering ?

( if your question fails to reject the null hypothesis - test another year vs year or group vs group)


### Effect size
1. If there was a difference, what's the size of the effect?
2. Solve for power
3. What size sample would you need to increase the power (at an alpha level of .05)?
